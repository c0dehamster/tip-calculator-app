## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   BEM naming convention
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second attempt on this project. I learned more about the HTML form component, form input validation, and this time, I managed to finish the project.

The description did not specify certain details, like how the app should handle non-numerical input values. I decided to provide an error message. Another way to solve this problem would be to prevent a user from entering any characters but digits.

To make a group of mutually excluding buttons, I decided to use radio buttons stripped of their default styling. It allowed to simplify the JS code required to make them work.

### Continued development

I should learn more about keeping my code concise and readable as it grew quite clunky this time.

### Useful resources
