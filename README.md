## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM naming convention

### What I learned

For this project, I learned about HTML forms, input validation with JavaScript, ways to create responsive layouts using display: grid.

### Continued development

I haven't found a good way to make the reset button active only when some of the form fields are filled. The method I used involves passing the function that toggles the reset button on and off as a callback to every event listener on the page. This works but I would like to know the proper solution.

This is the first time I tried to use BEM. It made naming elements somewhat easier. However, I wasn't sure about appropriate class names for certain elements. Should definitely see more examples of the naming rules used in practice.
